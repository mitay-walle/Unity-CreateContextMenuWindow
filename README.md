# Problem

## I. Context Menu missclicks close
More grow list and depth it's became hard to not missclick, and close context menu, start over and over again
## II. Context menu nested navigation
nested nature of context menu is flexible for organization, but 'Hover-to-open' with big nested hierarchies became unusable
# Solution
Display 'Assets/Create/...' items as EditorWindow with hierarchy buttons
<br>I. missclick is doesn't matter
<br>II. no need to Hover-to-navigate

# Summary
- UPM package
- open with Windows/Create Context Menu Window
- scrollview for big amount of items, (saves its state!)
- change Indent and button size to customize window for your needs
